\chapter{Abstract}\label{Abstract}
The demand for high-quality video games is ever increasing. This entails every aspect of video game creation, such as graphic fidelity, sound design, gameplay innovation, or novel game design approaches. However, the ambition to tell truly interactive and dynamic stories is also a significant factor contributing to this trend. This thesis aims to create a novel game mechanic that supports narrative gameplay. The presented game mechanic is based on the exchange of information between the player and NPCs and among NPCs themselves. By modeling the NPCs as intelligent agents in a multi-agent system, techniques from this field are used to give the agents an autonomous behavior as they move through a 3D environment. A classification for different types of gameplay focusing on dynamic gameplay is created, and the developed prototype is compared to other current games in this classification. The resulting system creates a playground for varied narrative scenarios that are not previously defined by a game designer but can be explored by the player and are supported by the game systems.
