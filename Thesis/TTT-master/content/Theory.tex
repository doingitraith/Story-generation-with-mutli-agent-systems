This chapter present the various fields of study, that were encountered or utilized while developing the game mechanic and its implementing prototype game. This includes fundamental story, game and quest theory, information theory, multi-agent systems, consensus protocols, emotion engines and inference engines.
\section{What is a story?}
There exist a multitude of definition on what a story is. Rayfield argues that story is a narrative item that exists throughout all cultures. He concludes that there exist a universal concept of a certain structure that listeners will recognize as a story. He limits this structure by degree of complexity and argues that listeners will only recognize the structure as story within certain minimal and maximal bounds of complexity. These bounds would then be the same across all cultures. \cite{Rayfield1972} Scheub takes another approach and sees story more as "a means whereby people come to terms with their lives, their past; it is a way of of understanding their relationship within the context of their traditions. It is a means of accessing and valuing history: in the end story \textit{is} history." \cite{Scheub1998} One thing that most definitions have in common however is that stories are an important tool for humans. Stories help us to interpret and process information and experiences. They enrich subjectively perceived facts and form them into each person's individual truth. This is the \textit{"meaning"} of a story.
