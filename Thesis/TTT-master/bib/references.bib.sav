  abstract  = {In this paper we explore the design of a design fiction as an iterative process of
interweaving storytelling and world building. With the design fiction Data Economy,
we present how we have imagined and externalized a data obsessed future through a
protagonist, narratives, plots and diegetic prototypes; this includes the short stories
Memoirs of Jesse, the short film Data Economy and a number of designed objects. Data
Economy explores how far people are willing to go to satisfy their individualistic
hunger to consume by creating a tension between consumerism and data collection. By
analyzing the design fiction, we discuss social and ethical issues of data privacy.
With a focus on narratives, plots, protagonists and diegetic prototypes, we argue
that the designerly potential of design fiction lies in its ability to interweave
the literary methods of storytelling with the designerly methods of world building.},

Much of the loop of the game revolves around leaving the city to complete quests, then returning to the city again, and repeat. In this paper, I take a closer look at the boundaries of the city. I begin by proposing a model to help define what a city's boundary is and how it is expressed to the player. Then, I look at how and why players cross those borders back and forth. Through this, I hope to facilitate a better understanding of how the city functions in roleplaying games},
